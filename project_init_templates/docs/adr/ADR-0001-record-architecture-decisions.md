# ADR-0001: Record Architectural Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context

This project prioritizes long-term maintainability and explicit structure.

Architectural decisions must be discoverable and version-controlled.

## Decision

All meaningful architectural decisions will be recorded in Markdown ADR files under docs/adr/.

## Consequences

- Decisions become permanent historical artifacts.
- Changes must be intentional.
- Refactors must respect prior decisions unless superseded.

## Alternatives Considered

- Inline documentation only
- Wiki-only documentation
- No formal decision records

Rejected due to lack of traceability.
