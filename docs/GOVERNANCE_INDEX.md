# GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md — Structured Mode v2

This document is the authoritative index of all governance, policy,

# 2. Governance Hierarchy

If documents conflict, precedence is:

1. PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (core philosophy)
2. SECURITY_POLICY.md (never weaken security)
3. MIGRATION_POLICY.md (never corrupt data)
4. VERSIONING_AND_RELEASE_POLICY.md (never break contracts silently)
5. ARCHITECTURE.md (preserve structure)
6. ROADMAP.md (execution intent)
7. FILE_MAP.md (modification targeting)

Security and data integrity override convenience.

# 3. Change Classification Matrix

Before making changes, classify them:

Feature:
- Follow ROADMAP
- Version bump MINOR
- Update CHANGELOG

Refactor:
- Preserve contracts
- PATCH bump
- Verify parity

Bug Fix:
- PATCH bump
- Verify no unintended behavior drift

Breaking Change:
- ADR required
- MAJOR bump
- Migration plan required (if persistence affected)

Security Fix:
- PATCH bump (or MAJOR if breaking)
- Document under Security in CHANGELOG

Migration:
- Follow MIGRATION_POLICY
- Align version bump accordingly

# 4. Required Pre-Change Checklist

Before making structural changes:

- [ ] Identify affected layer(s)
- [ ] Confirm milestone alignment
- [ ] Check if public contract changes
- [ ] Check if schema changes
- [ ] Check if security posture changes
- [ ] Determine required version bump
- [ ] Determine if ADR required

Do not proceed without classification.

---

# 5. Required Pre-Release Checklist

Before release:

- [ ] All milestone completion criteria satisfied
- [ ] Definition of Done satisfied
- [ ] Runtime verification report completed
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Version bump aligned with policy
- [ ] Migration rules satisfied (if applicable)
- [ ] Security baseline verified

---

# 6. AI Compliance Rule

AI agents must:

- Read all governance files before modifying structure.
- Not introduce breaking changes silently.
- Not weaken security posture.
- Not modify migrations improperly.
- Not change public contracts without ADR + version bump.
- Not bypass Definition of Done.

If uncertain, ask for clarification.

---

# 7. Guiding Principle

Governance exists to prevent silent drift.

Structure protects maintainability.  
Versioning protects stability.  
Migration discipline protects data.  
Security protects users.  
Verification protects confidence.  

Follow governance deliberately.
